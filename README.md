# SQLizing Success: IronHack Competitor Analysis & Growth Strategies

## Project Overview

Welcome to the IronHack Competitor Analysis & Growth Strategies project! In this analysis, we delve into the competitive landscape of coding schools, utilizing SwitchUp's web site to extract key market insights for IronHack (IH). Our focus areas include untapped markets, course gaps, badge impact on pricing, and strategic pricing opportunities.

## Project Structure

### 1. ERD: How did we structure our analysis & database?

We designed our analysis using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the relationships between different data entities and ensure a structured approach to our database.

### 2. Business Questions & Initial Hypotheses

- **Business Questions:**
  - What were our initial thoughts (hypothesis)?
  - What business questions were we trying to answer?

- **Initial Hypotheses:**
  - Expanding course offerings for new teaching domains and high-demand markets.
  - Implementing strategic pricing adjustments for competitive growth.

### 3. Data Collection & Processing

- **Data Source:**
  - Utilized SwitchUp's database.

- **Data Points:**
  - Gathered information on schools, locations, courses, badges, and prices.
  - Conducted web scraping for data collection.

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Faced challenges with special characters.
  - Overcame issues and saved the cleaned DataFrame as a CSV file.

### 4. Database & SQL Queries

- **Database Creation:**
  - Created a SQL DataFrame.

- **SQL Queries:**
  - Formulated and executed business-related SQL queries in MySQL.

### 5. Analysis & Visualization

- **Hypothetical Testing:**
  - Explored the correlation between Job support and overall success.
  - Analyzed the impact of badges on pricing using statistical methods.

- **Plots:**
  - Created visualizations comparing Ironhack with other schools in terms of course prices, badges, locations, and comments.

### 6. Conclusion

Our analysis uncovered:

- Lack of diversity in Ironhack courses, particularly in high-demand areas like data science, AI, and engineering.
- Identification of countries with high competitor activity but lacking Ironhack courses, signaling potential business growth opportunities.
- Positive correlation between the number of badges and course prices, suggesting an opportunity to influence pricing via badges.
- Suggestions for potential increased enrollment through price adjustments.

## Challenges Faced

- **Data Formatting Hurdle:**
  - Importing comment data into SQL posed challenges due to special characters.

- **Cleaning Roadblocks:**
  - Issues with special characters hindered data cleaning and import processes.

- **Time Constraints:**
  - Insufficient time for comprehensive data cleaning and import tasks.

- **Strategic Solution:**
  - Focused on utilizing only numeric data to overcome project goals.
